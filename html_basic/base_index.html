    <h1>Welcome to My First Webpage</h1>

    <p>
        This is my very first structured HTML page. I am learning how to build
        websites step by step and understanding how HTML works.

    <h2>About My Learning Journey</h2>

    <p>
        Web development is an exciting skill that allows me to create real
        projects on the internet. Every small concept I learn builds my
        confidence and improves my problem-solving ability.

    <h3>Why I Am Excited About Coding</h3>

    <p>
        Coding gives me the power to create solutions and express ideas
        digitally. It challenges me to think logically and creatively at the
        same time.
    </p>

    <p>
        As I continue practicing, I know my skills will grow stronger.
        Consistency is key, and every line of code I write brings me closer
        to becoming better at web development.
